## Intro statement
This pipeline finds ancestral states of each polymorphic site in clinVar (Test case).
The project can be used to study the evolution of genome since it is able to find the ancestral states of a large number of genetic variants. 
## What's the problem?
Finding the ancestral states of a large number of genetic variants (provided by database or user).
## Why should we solve it?
The results provided by this project will give researchers a large number of ancestral states data which helps them with their researches.
